            <P>Hey there,</P>
            <P>If you are wondering what is a graduate civil engineer doing here... Looking for a developer/software engineer job. Here's a short story, Back in march 2020, the first lockdown!</P>
            <P>Physical classes switched to online, waking early morning and leaving to college switched to setting Up a fancy background for the video conference.</P>
            <P>Now, I'm someone who'd like to be occupied, try and be productive. During Covid I'd a lot of time, which means... A lot of time to think.</P>
            <P>That is when I started writing code snippets, for small calculation in my engineering subjects, using C language.</P>
            <P>I got a lot of appreciation from my professors for the work I was doing. It also helped me understand the subjects well.</P>
            <P>Thats where it all started.</P>
            <P>After knowing the advantages of OOPS over POP I couldn't stop myself from learning Java. Thanks to W3 schools and YouTube. Trust me, java changed the way I looked at programming languages.</P>

            <P>My inspiration, <strong>Konrad Zuse</strong>  </P>
            <P>The person behind world's first program-controlled computer Z1.</P>
            <P>A German <em>Civil Engineer</em>...</P>
            <P>He built the computer to calculate the complex equations he came across. </P>
            <P>Yup, the same reason why Iâ€™m here.</P>
